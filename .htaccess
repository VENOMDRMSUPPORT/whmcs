# NOTE: This environment uses nginx as the frontend web server.
# Apache .htaccess rewrite rules are NOT processed by nginx.
# Guest homepage redirect is handled instead via WHMCS hook:
#   includes/hooks/venom_homepage_redirect.php
#
# The block below is for Apache-based deployments (if the stack ever
# switches from nginx to Apache httpd). It serves landing.php for the
# exact root "/" while preserving all WHMCS routing via index.php.
