## LANGUAGE POLICY — STRICTLY ENFORCED

**All project files must be written in English only.**

This applies without exception to:
- All source code files (PHP, JS, CSS, SQL, etc.)
- Code comments and inline documentation
- Commit messages
- Changelog and documentation files (`.docs/`, `README`, etc.)
- Variable names, function names, class names
- Database values that are developer-facing (config keys, log messages, etc.)
- Any file added to this repository

**Arabic or any other non-English language is strictly forbidden** inside
project files. When generating, editing, or reviewing any file in this
workspace, always use English only. If existing content contains Arabic text,
translate it to English before proceeding.

Violation of this rule means the contribution must be rejected or rewritten.
